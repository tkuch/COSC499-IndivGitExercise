# Individual Git Exercise for COSC 499
## Description
A simple programming exercise to practice using GitHub. The simple program is a sortable array written in Java. It includes two independent features by either sorting a list of integers or strings.

## Sortable Features
On startup, the program will prompt the user to select a String or Integer array. If the user types anything other than "string" or "integer" then the program will display a message telling them that their input was invalid and the program will end. If the user inputs their choice correctly, then they will advance further into the program.

### List of Strings
If the user has chosen to sort a list of strings, then they will be prompted to enter 5 words. Once they have entered 5 words, the console will display the user's list, followed by the same list sorted in alphabetical order.
